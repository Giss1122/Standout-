<h2>About Me</h2>
<u1>
    <h1>Welcome to my Digital Portfolio!</h1>
    <img src ="Contact1.jpeg" alt="About me" width="300">
    <p> My name is Giselle Imperia and I am majoring in Interactive Design with a minor in Marketing. 
        My goal is to become a Designer for a fashion based company or to 
        be in the fashion marketing field. I would also like to start a clothing company business on the side. 
        In my Digital Portfolio I have images and description of my work, future plans, and my personal contact card.
        Feel free to look around!

<h2>My Work</h2>
<u1>
    <h2>Artwork/Designs</h2>
    <li>Design 1: "Separation"
    <p>I made this design in my Design 1 class and ultimately loved the design
        and I would like to experiment with hoodie printing with this specific design.</p>
    </li>
    <img src ="Star3.jpeg" alt="Star Design" width="300">
    <li> Artwork 1: "The Dress"
       <p> I made this Artwork in my Design 1 class and I really enjoyed and had fun
        using mixed media to create this piece. I made it using magazine cutouts, newspaper cutouts, markers, and colored pencils.</p>
    </li>
    <img src ="MagDress.JPG" alt="Dress" width="300">
    <p></p>
    <li> Artwork 2: "memory"</li>
    <p>I made this when I was having a hard time and all I could think of was wanting to be in the comfort of my room. There is something so comforting 
        about being in your own space. It is peaceful and that is what I wanted to show in this piece. </p>
    <img src="MyPeace.JPG" alt="Peace" width="300">
    <li> Artwork 3: "Fashion Design Collage"</li>
    <p>This artwork was also made in my Design class and I love how assymetrical it is. I also used magazine cutouts to enhance the piece. It is all about fashion Design.</p>
    <img src="MagDream.JPG" alt="Dream" width="300">
    <li>Artwork 4: "Magazine Girls"</li>
    <p>There is no doubt that I get inspired using magazine cutouts to make collages. I love working with what I got and making it into something better and more fulfilling to me. I think using what I got is a reflection of my childhood and how I would use nothing to create my world into something.
    </p>
    <img src="MagGirls.JPG" alt="MagGirls" width="300">
    <li>Artwork 5: "Rage"</li>
    <p>I chose this name for the artwork because I wanted to visually show an enraged human. I feel like rage is such a temporary, intense feeling and it is something I wanted to capture here. I think rage usually stems from things and obstacles that just happen out of nowhere.</p>

    <h2> Designing for KSU Fashion Shows</h2>
    <li>KSU Fall 2023 "Upcycling" Show </li>
    <p>For this show, we had to create an up-cycled piece from whatever we had at home. Below are some images of what I made.</p>
    <p>Before:</p>

    <img src="extra2.JPG" alt="extra2" width="300">
    <p>Overall, I enjoyed this experience and it made me want to keep participating!</p>
    <li>KSU Spring 2024 "Bloom/Botanical" Show</li>
    <p>Look 1: "Floral 2-piece</p>

    <div id = "Plans">
<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>My future plans consist of creating a Clothing Brand and working for a fashion based company as a Marketer, UX Designer, or Fashion Designer.
    The name of my Clothing Brand would be:
<h2>STAND X OUTT </h2>
<img src="Standoutt.JPG" alt="SO" width="500">
<p>I chose this name because I believe that everyone should express themselves freely and be comfortable with their individuality and realize that you were meant to Standout! </p>
<p> I currently have a depop where I post thrifted goods as well as my upcycled work: @Standxoutt</p>
<img src="Standoutt1.JPG" alt="so1" width="300">
<img src="Standout2.JPG" alt="so2" width="300">
<p>For my business, I would love to make mixed media hoodies, Choker necklaces, and up-cycled work.
